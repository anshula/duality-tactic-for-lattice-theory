# Duality Tactic for Lattice Theory
This new Coq tactic `duality` allows you to prove a lattice theory (in)equality if its dual has already been proven.

For a demo:
1. Compile with `make clean; make`.
2. Run `Duality.v` either from the command line, or from the Coq IDE.

Tested on Coq version 8.9.0.
